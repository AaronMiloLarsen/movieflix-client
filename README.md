Welcome to Movieflix!

Concept:


ALPHA VERSION

This is a movie review app that allows for full CRUD functionalty using React with Typescript. Users are able to post movies to watch, reviews talking about their experience and leaving comments on any reviews they please. Users are able to see, edit and delete all their owned content in their profile page. Admins are able to look up all users on the application and if need be delete users. 

PLANS FOR BETA:
1.Incorporate a ban function for admins in case of trouble makers.
2. Incorporate API's for movie databases as well as make use of facial recognition API's to allow users to post photo's capturing their reaction to just finiishing a movie!

Thanks for stopping by! See you for the beta!
